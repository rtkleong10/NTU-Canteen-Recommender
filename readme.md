# NTU Canteen Recommender
This is a Python GUI app to help users to find a canteen to eat at. This is a school group project I did for my CZ1003 Introduction to Computational Thinking class at NTU. My group mates are Yee Teng and Yan Li. The data about the stalls & food sold is dummy data.

## How to Run
- `python3 main.py`
